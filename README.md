# adventOfCode23

My participation in the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).

I really like coding and solving this sort of riddles. I haven't been able to tackle the problems as soon as they are released, and for that reason I'm not doing it in a competitive mood (maybe next year ðŸ˜ˆ).

Keep in mind that these are not optimized solutions, and you'll probably find horrendous stuff in it - deal with it as I am, by ignoring ðŸ˜„
